## Hello World!

This repository is for all my projects created in the course MAGD150.

## Projects

The projects below are ordered from oldest to newest. Clicking on the title will bring you to the files.
Under each one I've described what lesson these projects were teaching.

### [Project 1](https://github.com/SolvoAmoveo/MAGD150/tree/gh-pages/s19magd150lab01_fuller)
This was the first project that I was assigned, and my first experience with Processing 3.
It was to learn how to use basic features such as drawing lines and using grayscale coloring.

### [Project 2](https://github.com/SolvoAmoveo/MAGD150/tree/gh-pages/s19magd150lab02_fuller)
This second project was our first delve into more complex shapes and colors. 

### [Project 3](https://github.com/SolvoAmoveo/MAGD150/tree/gh-pages/s19magd150lab03_fuller)
This project was our first experience with different types of functions and ke words processing has, and using math.

### [Project 4](https://github.com/SolvoAmoveo/MAGD150/tree/gh-pages/s19magd150lab04_fuller)
This project was our first experience with loops, user input, and motion.

### [Project 5](https://github.com/SolvoAmoveo/MAGD150/tree/gh-pages/s19magd150lab05_fuller)
This was a follow up project to the 4th where we used included more user interaction in our project and started to use text.

### [Project 6](https://github.com/SolvoAmoveo/MAGD150/tree/gh-pages/s19magd150lab06_fuller)
This project was to help us learn making our own classes and functions.

### [Project 7](URL)
This project was our first experience with PVectors and Arrays. 
Comments in the code became a mandatory thing at this point.

### [Project 8](https://github.com/SolvoAmoveo/MAGD150/tree/gh-pages/s19magd150_lab08_fuller)
This project played around with loading text from a file, and formatting text.

### [Project 9](https://github.com/SolvoAmoveo/MAGD150/tree/gh-pages/s19magd150_lab09_fuller)
This project was our introduction to images, videos, and sound within processing.

### [Project 10 Part 1](https://github.com/SolvoAmoveo/MAGD150/tree/gh-pages/s19magd150lab10_fuller_part1)
### [Project 10 Part 2](https://github.com/SolvoAmoveo/MAGD150/tree/gh-pages/s19magd150lab10_fuller_part2)
This project was our first experience with 3D modelling in processing 3.
This included using a camera, changing the perspective, creating a 3d mesh and using basic 3d shape functions, as well as generating, saving, and applying a texture.
